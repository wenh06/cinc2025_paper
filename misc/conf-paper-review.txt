Abstract

Please highlight only the official test score in the abstract, as the cross-validation results are not directly comparable to the official challenge scores.
In the abstract you have the following sentence: “In cross validation on the public training data, our approach achieved a Challenge score of 0.451” – The goal here is to compare all the teams with just a unique scoring method on the hidden test. So please do not show any results in the training process. Please use the following link to find the mean challenge score: https://moody-challenge.physionet.org/2025/results/.


Discussion/Conclusions

The text does not explicitly compare with other papers or methods. It only mentions alternative techniques (CutMix, SMOTE), but not in the context of a fairness-based comparison.
